title: Custom Workflows
description: Step-by-step guide to building your own MCPN workflow
---

1. **Make a new YAML file** in your `.mcp-workflows` or `.workflows` folder:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .mcp-workflows
   touch .mcp-workflows/my-custom-workflow.yaml
   ```

2. **Define your workflow**:

   ### Basic Configuration
   ```yaml
   my_custom_mode:
     description: "Demonstrates a custom workflow mode"
     prompt: |
       You are now in "Custom Mode". Let's walk through a series of steps:
         1. ...
         2. ...
       Please follow this pattern for all tasks.
   ```

   ### With Parameters
   ```yaml
   custom_mode:
     description: "Workflow with parameter injection"
     parameters:
       thought:
         type: "string"
         description: "A thought to deeply reflect upon"
         required: true
       idea:
         type: "string"
         description: "An additional idea to consider"
     prompt: |
       Deeply reflect upon the provided thought.
       Here's the thought: {{ thought }}

       Additional idea to consider: {{ idea }}

       Reflect upon the implications/tradeoffs it may have as it relates to my current goals.
   ```

   ### With Tools (Situational Mode)
   ```yaml
   web_debugger_mode:
     description: "Debug my web application with browser logs"
     prompt: |
       Deeply reflect upon all of this and think about why this isn't working.
       Theorize 4-6 different possible sources of the problem.
     tools: getConsoleLogs, getConsoleErrors, getNetworkLogs, getNetworkErrors, takeScreenshot
   ```

   ### With Sequential Tools
   ```yaml
   web_debugger_mode:
     description: "Debug my web application with browser logs"
     prompt: |
       Deeply reflect upon all of this and think about why this isn't working.
       Theorize 4-6 different possible sources of the problem.
     toolMode: sequential
     tools: getConsoleLogs, getConsoleErrors, getNetworkLogs, getNetworkErrors, takeScreenshot
   ```

   ### Advanced Tool Configuration
   ```yaml
   deep_thinking_mode:
     description: "Reflect on a thought and produce a reflection"
     parameters:
       thought:
         type: string
         description: "A thought to deeply reflect upon"
         required: true
     prompt: |
       Deeply reflect upon the provided thought.
       Reflect upon the implications/tradeoffs it may have as it relates to my current goals.
     toolMode: "sequential"
     tools:
       analyze_thought: analyze a previously generated thought
       explore_perspectives: think about additional perspectives given the analysis
       apply_findings:
         prompt: implement the findings of the analysis
         optional: true
   ```

3. **Use the workflow**:
   - If you've installed the MCPN server using `npx -y mcpn@latest init`
   - Reference your workflow in your MCP client by its name (e.g., `my_custom_mode`)
   - For Cursor, you can configure your MCPN server like this:
     ```json
     {
       "mcpServers": {
         "workflows-mcp": {
           "command": "npx",
           "args": ["mcpn@latest server", "--config", "/path/to/.mcp-workflows", "--preset", "thinking,coding"]
         }
       }
     }
     ```

4. **Test & Iterate**:
   - Add or remove sections, prompts, or parameters as you refine your workflow
   - Experiment with different tool modes (sequential vs. situational)
   - Share your workflow configurations with your team via version control

## Parameter Types

You can define various parameter types in your workflows:

- **String**:
  ```yaml
  name:
    type: "string"
    description: "User's name"
    required: true
  ```

- **Number**:
  ```yaml
  limit:
    type: "number"
    description: "Maximum items to return"
    default: 10
  ```

- **Boolean**:
  ```yaml
  includeArchived:
    type: "boolean"
    description: "Include archived items"
    default: false
  ```

- **Enum**:
  ```yaml
  sortOrder:
    type: "enum"
    enum: ["asc", "desc"]
    description: "Sort direction"
    default: "asc"
  ```

- **Array**:
  ```yaml
  tags:
    type: "array"
    description: "List of tags to filter by"
    items:
      type: "string"
      description: "A tag value"
  ```

- **Object**:
  ```yaml
  filters:
    type: "object"
    description: "Complex filter object"
    properties:
      status:
        type: "enum"
        enum: ["active", "inactive", "pending"]
        description: "Status filter"
  ```
